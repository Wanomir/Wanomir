🙌🏻 Hi, I’m Ivan (aka Wanomir).
I’m interested in Data Science 👨🏻‍💻, Crypto 🪙, Photography 📸 and Color Correction 🎥.
Currently I study and dive into Data Science, while making money as a manager on the crypto project.
I’m would be happy to participate in real DS project as an intern.
Feel free to reach me ✉️ wanomir@yandex.com

  p.s. although I was born and currently live in Russia, I do not support the government of this country, especially the war.
