Hi! My name is Ivan Romadin, but I ofthen use the nickname WanomiR 🤖.  
I am currently studying data science with Practicum by Yandex 👨‍🎓. I also work at a local cryptocurrency project 🪙. My duties here vary, but they also include data analysis. I truly love working with data 🤩. My goal is to dive deep into statistics and machine learning. 🤓
